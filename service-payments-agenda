# Service Payments Agenda – Preventive Control Design

This initiative documents the design of a centralized payment agenda to manage service payments executed through automatic debit mechanisms.

The solution was developed within the **Services Payments area**, focusing on improving predictability, control, and auditability of recurring payments.

> This documentation is conceptual and does not include real invoices, providers, amounts, or financial institutions.

## Business Context

Service payments executed via automatic debit were managed in a decentralized and reactive manner, limiting visibility over upcoming debits and increasing the risk of failed payments.

---

## Risk Addressed

- Failed payments due to insufficient funds or limits  
- Late or missed service payments  
- Operational rework and service disruptions  
- Lack of end-to-end traceability for audit and accounting purposes  

---

## Control Objective

Ensure timely and complete payment of services through centralized planning, visibility of upcoming debits, and structured tracking.

---

## Control Design

- Centralized registration of service invoices  
- Mandatory attachment of supporting documentation  
- Payment calendar with upcoming debit visibility  
- Anticipation of funding needs  
- Status tracking from invoice receipt to payment  

---

## Control Classification

- **Control Type:** Preventive  
- **Nature:** Application-based  
- **Frequency:** Continuous  
- **Owner Area:** Services Payments
