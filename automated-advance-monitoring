## Business Context

Pending advances were previously monitored through manual reviews, spreadsheets, and individual follow-ups.  
This approach was time-consuming, prone to human error, and lacked consistent traceability for audit purposes.

## Risk Addressed

- Advances not followed up in a timely manner  
- Manual errors in identifying responsible users or statuses  
- Lack of evidence of follow-up actions  
- Delays impacting financial close and internal controls

## Control Objective

Ensure timely detection and standardized follow-up of pending advances to strengthen control over advanced funds and improve auditability.
