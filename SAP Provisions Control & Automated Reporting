# SAP Provisions Control & Automated Reporting

This project describes a control design focused on improving the accuracy, timeliness, and traceability of provisions through automation and standardized reporting.

The initiative integrates SAP operational data with internal control files to reduce manual effort and strengthen internal controls.

---

## Business Context

Provision controls relied heavily on manual data handling after extracting information from SAP systems.  
This approach increased operational effort, introduced error risks, and limited traceability for audit and control purposes.

The project aimed to standardize and automate the flow of SAP data into provision controls and reporting.

---

## Risk Addressed

- Errors or omissions during manual data processing  
- Delays in identifying pending or unmatched items  
- Inconsistent reporting across users  
- Weak audit trail supporting provision balances  

---

## Control Objective

Ensure accurate, timely, and traceable control of provisions by automating data integration, standardizing reporting, and enabling auditable evidence generation.

---

## Control Design

### SAP Data Integration
- Integration of service and material-related SAP data
- Automated processing to replace manual data manipulation
- Standardized execution steps to ensure consistency

### Provisions Reporting
- Consolidated provision analysis
- Automated generation of summary reports
- Automated distribution through institutional communication channels

## Monitoring & Visualization

The control design includes dashboards tailored to different audiences:

- **Operational dashboards** for monthly follow-up and pending item management  
- **Executive dashboards** for high-level financial visibility  

This approach balances detailed operational control with executive-level reporting needs.
